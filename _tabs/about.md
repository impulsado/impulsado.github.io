Hi! My name is impu. 
I'm a cybersecurity student and I love working on projects. I like challenges and making my life more difficult (others call it more security layers) that's why I made this blog. 
Here I publish my little (at the moment) knowledge and personal projects that I'm doing.

If you are interested in contacting me, you can DM me on [Instragram](https://www.instagram.com/impulsado/).


Don't forget to check the site often!
