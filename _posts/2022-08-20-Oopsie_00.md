# Reverse Shell
Search for common directories. This is a Web Server so is a good idea to check `/var/www/html/xxx/`. 
There is a username and a password. Login as robert and search the ``user.txt``.

Find the user group and the files that belong to it.
Found executable file in `/usr/bin/` named `bugtracker` that only `bugtracker` group can 
execute.
