# Thought process
1. View running services with `nmap`.
2. Check if there were subdirectories with the `dirbust`.
3. Since it was a LogIn, see if SQL Injection can be done.


# Resolution
To Login a Web is just a SELECT to the database, but if in the username you write **admin'--** the rest of the query is commented out and does not look for a password. SQL Injection. 

> Normal Login Query
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' and password='123456aA'
```

> Query with SQL Injection
```sql
SELECT * FROM members WHERE username = 'admin'--' AND password = '123456aA'
```
